Humpy is an open source library which is used for creating arrays
 Numpy is widely sed in scientific computations, mathematic statistics, fourier transorms   basic algebra

                            Numpy array Vs sequences
 Numpy array has a fixed size , python lists is dnamic and size is changable
 Numpy is a homogenous data type , all the elements should be of same datatype
 where python sequence you can have multiple datatype elements
 --- Numpy array has functions for advanced mathematics and it can work on large amount of data more efficiently
 --- Numpy is a foundational library for advanced library
